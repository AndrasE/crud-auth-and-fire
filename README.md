  Full stack crud application using React with Firestore database & 
  <br>
  Firebase/OAuth options with Protected Routes
</h3>

<br>

## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

<p>This project demonstrates a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) React application with a backend powered by Firebase. I chose Firebase for its ease of integration and robust features, allowing me to focus on the core functionality while leveraging its capabilities. <br /> After carefully planning the project's requirements, I implemented the CRUD functionality using React components and Firebase's Realtime Database. I then integrated Firebase authentication (Google, Facebook, OTP) to secure the application and added protected routes to restrict access to unauthorized users. The app is designed with React Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface. <br /> For a more in-depth breakdown of the project's evolution and features, and practical examples, please visit the app and click on the logo. You will find both an About and About More section.</p>

<p> Key Features: 
<li>Authentication - Implements user authentication using Firebase, allowing users to sign in via Google, Facebook, or by phone using one-time password texts.</li> 
<li> Protected Routes - Restricts access to certain routes based on user authentication, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data. </li> 
<li>Context Provider - Utilizes a context provider to manage user authentication state, ensuring consistent access across the application.</li>
