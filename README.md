# crud-auth-and-fire
Reactjs CRUD using Firestore as Database with Firebase/Auth options and Protected Routes

Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

I think the title is self-explanatory. 
It took me for a while to complete this project as part of my self-study.
If you click on the logo or the footer section you will find some further details of this project, 
including difficulties, tutorials and references. Or just simple check the About.jsx.

I hope you like it and i hope it will offer you some help with your own project. 

Take care, code safe! ðŸ’»
