  React crud application with Firestore database
  <br>
 & Firebase/OAuth options with Protected Routes
</h3>

## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

This project demonstrates a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) React application with a backend powered by Firebase. I chose Firebase for its ease of integration and robust features, allowing me to focus on the core functionality while leveraging its capabilities.

After carefully planning the project's requirements, I implemented the CRUD functionality using React components and Firebase's Realtime Database. I then integrated Firebase authentication (Google, Facebook, OTP) to secure the application and added protected routes to restrict access to unauthorized users. The app is designed with React Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface.

For a more in-depth breakdown of the project's evolution and features, and practical examples, please visit the app and click on the logo. You will find both an About and About More section.
